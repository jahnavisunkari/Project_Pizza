Pizza Sales Analysis | SQL + Excel Dashboard Project

Objective:

To analyse business performance by extracting insights from a pizza order dataset — identifying top-selling items, peak ordering times, sales by category/size, and overall revenue trends. The project replicates a real-world retail scenario where decision-makers need digestible insights to improve operations and profitability.
